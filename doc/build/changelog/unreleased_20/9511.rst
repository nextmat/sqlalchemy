    Fixed critical regression in PostgreSQL dialects such as asyncpg which rely
    upon explicit casts in SQL in order for datatypes to be passed to the
    driver correctly, where a :class:`.String` datatype would be cast along
    with the exact column length being compared, leading to implicit truncation
    when comparing a ``VARCHAR`` of a smaller length to a string of greater
    length regardless of operator in use (e.g. LIKE, MATCH, etc.). The
    PostgreSQL dialect now omits the length from ``VARCHAR`` when rendering
    these casts.
