    Fixed issue where the :meth:`_sql.BindParameter.render_literal_execute`
    method would fail when called on a parameter that also had ORM annotations
    associated with it. In practice, this would be observed as a failure of SQL
    compilation when using some combinations of a dialect that uses "FETCH
    FIRST" such as Oracle along with a :class:`_sql.Select` construct that uses
    :meth:`_sql.Select.limit`, within some ORM contexts, including if the
    statement were embedded within a relationship primaryjoin expression.
